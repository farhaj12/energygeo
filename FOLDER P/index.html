    <h1>Advantages</h1>
    <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Geothermal energy is renewable; it is not a fossil fuel that will be eventually used up. The Earth is continuously radiating heat out from its core, and will continue to do so for billions of years.</li>
    <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Some form of geothermal energy can be accessed and harvested anywhere in the world.
        <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Using geothermal energy is relatively clean. Most systems only emit water vapor, although some emit very small amounts of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, and particulates.
        <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Geothermal power plants can last for decades and possibly centuries. If a reservoir is managed properly, the amount of extracted energy can be balanced with the rock’s rate of renewing its heat.
        <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Unlike other renewable energy sources, geothermal systems are “baseload.” This means they can work in the summer or winter, and are not dependent on changing factors such as the presence of wind or sun. Geothermal power plants produce electricity or heat 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <li style="font-size:1.4em;">The process of injecting high-pressure streams of water into the Earth can result in minor seismic activity, or small earthquakes.
        <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Geothermal plants have been linked to subsidence, or the slow sinking of land. This happens as the underground fractures collapse upon themselves. This can lead to damaged pipelines, roadways, buildings, and natural drainage systems.
        <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Geothermal plants can release small amounts of greenhouse gases such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide.
        <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Water that flows through underground reservoirs can pick up trace amounts of toxic elements such as arsenic, mercury, and selenium. These harmful substances can be leaked to water sources if the geothermal system is not properly insulated.
        <li style="font-size:1.4em;">Although the process requires almost no fuel to run, the initial cost of installing geothermal technology is expensive. Developing countries may not have the sophisticated infrastructure or start-up costs to invest in a geothermal power plant. Several facilities in the Philippines, for example, were made possible by investments from American industry and government agencies. Today, the plants are Philippine-owned and operated.
